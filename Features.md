# Features

## Individual Finger Sensors
All fingers, excluding the thumb, has its own sensor. This allows for fine control over a hand model. Each finger moves independently of the others.

## Gyroscope and Accelerometer
The Flex Glove Controller features a gyroscope and an accelerometer to allow for orientation tracking, so you can see the hand onscreen match the movements you make.

## On-The-Fly Calibration
The flex sensors can be calibrated at any time to the range of motion required for any individual. With one press of a button the Flex Glove Controller will enter calibration mode, during which a few flexes of the glove will calibrate the glove to yoru range of motion.
