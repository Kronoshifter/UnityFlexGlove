# About

## The Development Team
Me, Myself, and I. When my academic advisor told me that there was a new class about virtual reality, I knew that I had to sign up right away. Virtual reality has always interested me, and it's been a blast learning about how it all works.

## Credits
Arduino Sketch was made by me, using the Uduino libraries to facilitate communication between Unity and the Flex Glove. The hand model and posing scripts are a part of the Hand Poser library on the asset store. All other code was created by me.
