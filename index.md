# Flex Glove Controller
The Flex Glove Controller is a one-of-a-kind controller that uses flex sensors to detect how much each finger has been bent, and a gyroscope and accelerometer to detect orientation. In short, the Flex Glove Controller is capable of transporting your hand into the digital world.

I've always been fascinated with virtual reality, especially the concept of entering a digital realm. Films like Tron and Digimon, as well as games like the Mega Man Battle Network series inspired vivid imagery of entering vast digital worlds to connect with and explore. Naturally, when I saw a flex glove as an example of a project to pursue for this course, I jumped on the opportunity. Projects like this have been attempted in the past, such as the oft maligned Nintendo Power Glove, but the technology didn't exist until recently to fully take advantage of such a system.
